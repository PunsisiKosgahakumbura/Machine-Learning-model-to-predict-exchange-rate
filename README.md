This study utilized machine learning regression models, namely Linear Regression, RandomForestRegressor, and DecisionTreeRegressor, to predict the exchange rate of Sri Lanka. Training these models with 423 data instances, the Linear Regression model exhibited the highest validation Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 173.1658, indicating larger prediction errors compared to the other models. The RandomForestRegressor showed improved performance with a lower validation MSE of 8.6204, suggesting better predictive capability. However, the DecisionTreeRegressor outperformed both models with the lowest validation MSE of 1.0109, indicating superior predictive accuracy. Consequently, the Decision Tree Regressor was deemed the most effective model for predicting the exchange rate of Sri Lanka, offering the lowest mean squared error and highest accuracy level during validation and evaluation stages.
